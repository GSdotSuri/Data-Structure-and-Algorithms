# Data-Structure-and-Algorithms in Java

This repository is a collection of algorithms, data structures and coding challenges on which I will be working on daily. In this repository, the algorithms/solutions will be implemented considering effecient Time and Space Complexity approaches. All the solutions are 100% correct and tested against various test cases.

Most of the questions here will be taken from LeetCode. You can also try [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) for practice.

Alongside basic problems, this repo will also contain most commonly asked and must-know algorithms and data structures based questions which are being asked in the interviews of most of the Tech Giants.:fire::fire: <br>
I have a target of solving more than 300 questions from LeetCode.<br>
<b>NOTE: You may find multiple solution codes for the same problem.</b><br>

Not only intermediate coders, even those who have recently started with DS and Algo can also refer this repository and follow the same path as mine. :star: :star:
